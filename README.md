#Library Challenge: 

You will be given an hour to create a set of tests for the service class. 
(If you complete them before the hour, implement some of the repo methods)

Push the changes to a team branch.

Afterwards, I'll be telling you all to pull from another team's branch.
You will be implementing the service logic based on their unit tests!
